class Solution:
    """
    This solution implements a custom sorting comparator, so that our
    nums will be sorted in the order that generates the largest number.
    
    For example, given 34323 and 3432, how should we compare them so we
    will end up with 3432|34323 instead of 34323|3432?
       
    First we can just iterate both string one at a time to compare the digits.
    
        a: 3432
        b: 34323
           ====
        i: 01234
        
    When we reach index 3, we\'ve exhausted all digits in \'a\'. But we still don\'t
    know if a or b should come first. At least we know they are not equal.
    What if we extend \'a\' and keep comparing:
    
        a: 3432|3432
        b: 3432|3
           ====|=
        i: 0123|45678
    
    Now we\'ve exhausted all of \'b\'. And we still don\'t know if a or b should come
    first. So we extend \'b\' this time and keep comparing:
    
        a: 3432|3|432
        b: 3432|3|34323
           ====|=|<
        i: 0123|4|56789
    
    We now see that a is larger at index 5. This comparison tells us if we should
    put \'a\' before \'b\' for a largest number. So we will return -1 in our comparator.
