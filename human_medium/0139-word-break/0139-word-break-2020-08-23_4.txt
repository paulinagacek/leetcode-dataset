    #(2) Considering all possible substrings of s.
    #(3) If s[0:j] is breakable and s[j:i] is breakable, then s[0:i] is breakable. Equivalently, if dp[j] is True and s[j:i] is in the wordDict, then dp[i] is True.
    #(4) Our goal is to determine if dp[i] is breakable, and once we do, we don\'t need to consider anything else. This is because we want to construct dp.
    #(5) dp[len(s)] tells us if s[0:len(s)] (or equivalently, s) is breakable.
