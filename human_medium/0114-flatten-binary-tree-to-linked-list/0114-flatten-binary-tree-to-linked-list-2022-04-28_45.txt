    approach: 
    we can store the preorder taraversal of nodes in a stack
    then we can iterate over the stack and update the pointers of the
    current node. 
    if stack has let\'s say 4 nodes [TreeNode(1), TreeNode(2), TreeNode(3), TreeNode(4)]
    I will take a pointer, say curr and set it to stack[0] (root is also pointing at stack[0])
    now I will iterate over stack[1:]
    and set curr.right to node and curr.left to None
    update curr to current node
