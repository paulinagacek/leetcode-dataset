Let\'s Understood with an example:

"xxyy" -> ["x", "x", "y", "y"] // 1st List of all the substring
          ["x", "x", "yy"] // 2nd List of all the substring
          ["xx", "y", "y"] // 3rd List of all the substring
          ["xx", "yy"] // 4th List of all the substring

In the above example we can only have 4 possible list\'s

Our task is to return a list of all of these list\'s, that are possible
