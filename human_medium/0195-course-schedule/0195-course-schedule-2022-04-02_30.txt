        solution approach:
        1. create the adjacency list from given edges
        2. for each node, traverse graph starting at this node (BFS/DFS); 
            if we detect a loop, return False
        3. return True

        # create adjacency list
        graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
        for a,b in prerequisites:
            graph[a].append(b)
            #graph[b].append(a)  # no, because graph is directional!
                        
        for n in range(0,numCourses):
            Q = deque(graph[n])
            visited = set()
            while Q:
                m = Q.popleft()  # --> BFS
                #m = Q.pop()     # --> DFS
                if m==n:
                    # we detected a loop
                    return False
                visited.add(m)  # this is just for optimization, not strictly needed
                for neighbor in graph[m]:
                    if neighbor not in visited:
                        Q.append(neighbor)
        
        return True
