class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        hashmap = defaultdict()
        for w in strs:
            s = \'\'.join(sorted(w))
            if s not in hashmap:
                hashmap[s] = [w]
            else:
                hashmap[s].append(w)
        
        return hashmap.values()
		
1. iterate over each word in the list to find anagrams
2. sort the word to get the key for the group of anagrams
3. if the key doesnt exist assign it to the hashmap and append an original word inside the array
   as a starting point in the group. ([\'aet\': [\'ate\'])
4. if the key already exists it means we can append the anagram to the existing list in the hashmap
5. we return hashmap.values() as it will give us two dimensional array with the groups of anagrams


Time complexity: 0(n * (k logk))
Because we iterate n times over the list of strings - 0(n) and with each iteration we sort anagram - 0(k logk) where k is the length of the string.

Space complexity: 0(n)
