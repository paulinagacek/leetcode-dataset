        This is a constant memory variation of the solution,
        using in-place merge sort O(nlog(n)):
        
        1. Start with k = 0

        2. Set a window of size 2 x (2^k), we can completely detach the nodes from
           the original list for easier reasoning

        3. Inside the window, traverse to (2^k)th node (this is the mid of the window)
           (2^k)th node will be the start of the second half of the window

        4. Initialize a pointer to "start" and another pointer to "mid": (2^k)th node and
            an "end". Use these nodes to detach nodes from the main list
        
        5. Mergesort the two halfs into one sorted window and relink it back into
           the original list.
        
        6. Repeat #2 - 5 for nodes in groups of (2*2^k)
        
        7. Increase k by 1 and repeat #2 - 6 until (2*2^k) is greater than the next power of 2
           greater than total number of nodes
        
        Note:
        
        k = 0, 2*2^k == window size of 2, 2^k == 1 is the start of second half

            [-1,0,3,4,5]
        
        k = 3, 2*2^k == window size of 16.
