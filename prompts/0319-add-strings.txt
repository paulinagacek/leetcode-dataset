Solve this problem in Python:
Given two non-negative integers, `num^1` and `num^2` represented as string, return the sum of `num^1` and `num^2` as a string.
You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as `BigInteger`). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.
Example 1:
```
Input: num^1 = "11", num^2 = "123"
Output: "134"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: num^1 = "456", num^2 = "77"
Output: "533"
```
Example 3:
```
Input: num^1 = "0", num^2 = "0"
Output: "0"
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= num^1.length, num^2.length <= 104`
 `num^1` and `num^2` consist of only digits.
 `num^1` and `num^2` don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def addStrings(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        
```
