Solve this problem in Python:
Given two non-negative integers `num^1` and `num^2` represented as strings, return the product of `num^1` and `num^2`, also represented as a string.
Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
Example 1:
```
Input: num^1 = "2", num^2 = "3"
Output: "6"
```
Example 2:
```
Input: num^1 = "123", num^2 = "456"
Output: "56088"
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= num^1.length, num^2.length <= 200`
 `num^1` and `num^2` consist of digits only.
 Both `num^1` and `num^2` do not contain any leading zero, except the number `0` itself.

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def multiply(self, num1: str, num2: str) -> str:
        
```

Provide the code only, no explanation.
