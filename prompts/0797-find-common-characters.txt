Solve this problem in Python:
Given a string array `words`, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the `words` (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order.
Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
```
Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= words.length <= 100`
 `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
 `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        
```
