Solve this problem in Python:
You are given two integers `num^1` and `num^2`.
In one operation, you can choose integer `i` in the range `[0, 60]` and subtract `2i + num^2` from `num^1`.
Return the integer denoting the minimum number of operations needed to make `num^1` equal to `0`.
If it is impossible to make `num^1` equal to `0`, return `-1`.
Example 1:
```
Input: num^1 = 3, num^2 = -2
Output: 3
Explanation: We can make 3 equal to 0 with the following operations:
- We choose i = 2 and subtract 22 + (-2) from 3, 3 - (4 + (-2)) = 1.
- We choose i = 2 and subtract 22 + (-2) from 1, 1 - (4 + (-2)) = -1.
- We choose i = 0 and subtract 20 + (-2) from -1, (-1) - (1 + (-2)) = 0.
It can be proven, that 3 is the minimum number of operations that we need to perform.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: num^1 = 5, num^2 = 7
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be proven, that it is impossible to make 5 equal to 0 with the given operation.
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= num^1 <= 109`
 `-109 <= num^2 <= 109`

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def makeTheIntegerZero(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        
```
