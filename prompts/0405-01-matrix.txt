Solve this problem in Python:
Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return the distance of the nearest `0` for each cell.
The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is `1`.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/01-1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
```
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/01-2-grid.jpg)
```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
```
Constraints:
 `m == mat.length`
 `n == mat[i].length`
 `1 <= m, n <= 104`
 `1 <= m  n <= 104`
 `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
 There is at least one `0` in `mat`.
