Solve this problem in Python:
A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either `a` or `b`.
Given the three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, return the `nth` magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `109 + 7`.
Example 1:
```
Input: n = 1, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 2
```
Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3
Output: 6
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= n <= 109`
 `2 <= a, b <= 4  104`

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def nthMagicalNumber(self, n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        
```
