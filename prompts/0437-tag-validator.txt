Solve this problem in Python:
Given a string representing a code snippet, implement a tag validator to parse the code and return whether it is valid.
A code snippet is valid if all the following rules hold:
1. The code must be wrapped in a valid closed tag. Otherwise, the code is invalid.
2. A closed tag (not necessarily valid) has exactly the following format : `TAG\_CONTENT`. Among them, is the start tag, and is the end tag. The TAG\\_NAME in start and end tags should be the same. A closed tag is valid if and only if the TAG\\_NAME and TAG\\_CONTENT are valid.
3. A valid `TAG\_NAME` only contain upper-case letters, and has length in range [1,9]. Otherwise, the `TAG\_NAME` is invalid.
4. A valid `TAG\_CONTENT` may contain other valid closed tags, cdata and any characters (see note1) EXCEPT unmatched `<`, unmatched start and end tag, and unmatched or closed tags with invalid TAG\\_NAME. Otherwise, the `TAG\_CONTENT` is invalid.
5. A start tag is unmatched if no end tag exists with the same TAG\\_NAME, and vice versa. However, you also need to consider the issue of unbalanced when tags are nested.
6. A `<` is unmatched if you cannot find a subsequent `>`. And when you find a `<` or `, all the subsequent characters until the next > should be parsed as TAG\_NAME (not necessarily valid).`
7. The cdata has the following format : `CDATA\_CONTENT`. The range of `CDATA\_CONTENT` is defined as the characters between ` and the **first subsequent** ```` `.
8. `CDATA_CONTENT` may contain **any characters**. The function of cdata is to forbid the validator to parse `CDATA_CONTENT`, so even it has some characters that can be parsed as tag (no matter valid or invalid), you should treat it as **regular characters**.
**Example 1:**
```
Input: code = "
This is the first line

"
Output: true
Explanation:
The code is wrapped in a closed tag :
and
.
The TAG_NAME is valid, the TAG_CONTENT consists of some characters and cdata.
Although CDATA_CONTENT has an unmatched start tag with invalid TAG_NAME, it should be considered as plain text, not parsed as a tag.
So TAG_CONTENT is valid, and then the code is valid. Thus return true.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: code = "
>> ![cdata[]]

]>]]>>]
"
Output: true
Explanation:
We first separate the code into : start_tag|tag_content|end_tag.
start_tag -> "
"
end_tag -> ""
tag_content could also be separated into : text1|cdata|text2.
text1 -> ">> ![cdata[]] "
cdata -> "

]>", where the CDATA_CONTENT is "
]>"
text2 -> "]]>>]"
The reason why start_tag is NOT "
>>"
is because of the rule 6.
The reason why cdata is NOT "

]>]]>" is because of the rule 7.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: code = " "
Output: false
Explanation: Unbalanced. If "" is closed, then "" must be unmatched, and vice versa.
```
**Constraints:**
* `1 <= code.length <= 500`
* `code` consists of English letters, digits, `'<'`, `'>'`, `'/'`, `'!'`, `'['`, `']'`, `'.'`, and `' '`. ````

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, code: str) -> bool:
        
```

Provide the code only, no explanation.
