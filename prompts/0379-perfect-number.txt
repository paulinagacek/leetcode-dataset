Solve this problem in Python:
A [perfect number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect\_number) is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. A divisor of an integer `x` is an integer that can divide `x` evenly.
Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` is a perfect number, otherwise return `false`.
Example 1:
```
Input: num = 28
Output: true
Explanation: 28 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14
1, 2, 4, 7, and 14 are all divisors of 28.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: num = 7
Output: false
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= num <= 108`

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def checkPerfectNumber(self, num: int) -> bool:
        
```
