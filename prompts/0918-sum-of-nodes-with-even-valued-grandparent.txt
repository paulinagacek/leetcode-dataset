Solve this problem in Python:
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. If there are no nodes with an even-valued grandparent, return `0`.
A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/10/even^1-tree.jpg)
```
Input: root = [6,7,8,2,7,1,3,9,null,1,4,null,null,null,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: The red nodes are the nodes with even-value grandparent while the blue nodes are the even-value grandparents.
```
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/10/even^2-tree.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 0
```
Constraints:
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
 `1 <= Node.val <= 100`

Complete the following template:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sumEvenGrandparent(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
```
