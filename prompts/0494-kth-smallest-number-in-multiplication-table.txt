Solve this problem in Python:
Nearly everyone has used the [Multiplication Table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplication\_table). The multiplication table of size `m x n` is an integer matrix `mat` where `mat[i][j] == i  j` (1-indexed).
Given three integers `m`, `n`, and `k`, return the `kth` smallest element in the `m x n` multiplication table.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/multtable1-grid.jpg)
```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: The 5th smallest number is 3.
```
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/05/02/multtable2-grid.jpg)
```
Input: m = 2, n = 3, k = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The 6th smallest number is 6.
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= m, n <= 3  104`
 `1 <= k <= m  n`

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def findKthNumber(self, m: int, n: int, k: int) -> int:
        
```

Provide the code only, no explanation.
