Solve this problem in Python:
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/05/bst1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3]
Output: 1
```
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/05/bst2.jpg)
```
Input: root = [1,0,48,null,null,12,49]
Output: 1
```
Constraints:
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 104]`.
 `0 <= Node.val <= 105`
Note: This question is the same as 783:

Complete the following template:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def getMinimumDifference(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
```
