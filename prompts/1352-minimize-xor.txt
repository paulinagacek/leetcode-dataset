Solve this problem in Python:
Given two positive integers `num^1` and `num^2`, find the positive integer `x` such that:
 `x` has the same number of set bits as `num^2`, and
 The value `x XOR num^1` is minimal.
Note that `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.
Return the integer `x`. The test cases are generated such that `x` is uniquely determined.
The number of set bits of an integer is the number of `1`'s in its binary representation.
Example 1:
```
Input: num^1 = 3, num^2 = 5
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num^1 and num^2 are 0011 and 0101, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num^2, and the value 3 XOR 3 = 0 is minimal.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: num^1 = 1, num^2 = 12
Output: 3
Explanation:
The binary representations of num^1 and num^2 are 0001 and 1100, respectively.
The integer 3 has the same number of set bits as num^2, and the value 3 XOR 1 = 2 is minimal.
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= num^1, num^2 <= 109`

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def minimizeXor(self, num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
        
```

Provide the code only, no explanation.
