Solve this problem in Python:
Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/09/04/del\_node\_1.jpg)
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.

```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 0
Output: [5,3,6,2,4,null,7]
Explanation: The tree does not contain a node with value = 0.
```
Example 3:
```
Input: root = [], key = 0
Output: []
```
Constraints:
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
 `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`
 Each node has a unique value.
 `root` is a valid binary search tree.
 `-105 <= key <= 105`
Follow up: Could you solve it with time complexity `O(height of tree)`?

Complete the following template:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def deleteNode(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], key: int) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        
```
