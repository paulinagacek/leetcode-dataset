Solve this problem in Python:
You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.
Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst\_cameras\_01.png)
```
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,0]
Output: 1
Explanation: One camera is enough to monitor all nodes if placed as shown.
```
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2018/12/29/bst\_cameras\_02.png)
```
Input: root = [0,0,null,0,null,0,null,null,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: At least two cameras are needed to monitor all nodes of the tree. The above image shows one of the valid configurations of camera placement.
```
Constraints:
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
 `Node.val == 0`

Complete the following template:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
```

Provide the code only, no explanation.
