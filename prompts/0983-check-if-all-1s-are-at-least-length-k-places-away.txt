Solve this problem in Python:
Given an binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if all `1`'s are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample\_1\_1791.png)
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Each of the 1s are at least 2 places away from each other.
```
Example 2:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/15/sample\_2\_1791.png)
```
Input: nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: The second 1 and third 1 are only one apart from each other.
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
 `0 <= k <= nums.length`
 `nums[i]` is `0` or `1`

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def kLengthApart(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> bool:
        
```

Provide the code only, no explanation.
