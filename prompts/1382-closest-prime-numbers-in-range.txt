Solve this problem in Python:
Given two positive integers `left` and `right`, find the two integers `num^1` and `num^2` such that:
 `left <= num^1 < num^2 <= right` .
 Both `num^1` and `num^2` are prime numbers.
 `num^2 - num^1` is the minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.
Return the positive integer array `ans = [num^1, num^2]`. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the smallest `num^1` value. If no such numbers exist, return `[-1, -1]`.
Example 1:
```
Input: left = 10, right = 19
Output: [11,13]
Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are 11, 13, 17, and 19.
The closest gap between any pair is 2, which can be achieved by [11,13] or [17,19].
Since 11 is smaller than 17, we return the first pair.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: left = 4, right = 6
Output: [-1,-1]
Explanation: There exists only one prime number in the given range, so the conditions cannot be satisfied.
```
Constraints:
 `1 <= left <= right <= 106`

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def closestPrimes(self, left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
        
```

Provide the code only, no explanation.
