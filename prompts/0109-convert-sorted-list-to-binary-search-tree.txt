Solve this problem in Python:
Given the `head` of a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/17/linked.jpg)
```
Input: head = [-10,-3,0,5,9]
Output: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5]
Explanation: One possible answer is [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the shown height balanced BST.
```
Example 2:
```
Input: head = []
Output: []
```
Constraints:
 The number of nodes in `head` is in the range `[0, 2  104]`.
 `-105 <= Node.val <= 105`

Complete the following template:
```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        
```

Provide the code only, no explanation.
