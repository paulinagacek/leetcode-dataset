Solve this problem in Python:
Given two version strings, `version^1` and `version^2`, compare them. A version string consists of revisions separated by dots `'.'`. The value of the revision is its integer conversion ignoring leading zeros.
To compare version strings, compare their revision values in left-to-right order. If one of the version strings has fewer revisions, treat the missing revision values as `0`.
Return the following:
 If `version^1 < version^2`, return -1.
 If `version^1 > version^2`, return 1.
 Otherwise, return 0.
Example 1:
Input: version^1 = "1.2", version^2 = "1.10"
Output: -1
Explanation:
version^1's second revision is "2" and version^2's second revision is "10": 2 < 10, so version^1 < version^2.
Example 2:
Input: version^1 = "1.01", version^2 = "1.001"
Output: 0
Explanation:
Ignoring leading zeroes, both "01" and "001" represent the same integer "1".
Example 3:
Input: version^1 = "1.0", version^2 = "1.0.0.0"
Output: 0
Explanation:
version^1 has less revisions, which means every missing revision are treated as "0".
Constraints:
 `1 <= version^1.length, version^2.length <= 500`
 `version^1` and `version^2` only contain digits and `'.'`.
 `version^1` and `version^2` are valid version numbers.
 All the given revisions in `version^1` and `version^2` can be stored in a 32-bit integer.

Complete the following template:
```
class Solution:
    def compareVersion(self, version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
        
```
