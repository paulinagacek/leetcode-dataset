Solve this problem in Python:
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return its maximum depth.
A binary tree's maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.
Example 1:
![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/26/tmp-tree.jpg)
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```
Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```
Constraints:
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 104]`.
 `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

Complete the following template:
```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        
```
