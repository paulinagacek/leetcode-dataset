        1. Similar to Meetings Rooms II, we sort start and end timings, but here we also maintain number of passengers getting in  and number of passengers getting out. tuple => ( start/end time, passengers in/out )
        2. We keep on adding passengers, until we reach one end point (i.e if start < end)
        3. At any moment if passengers are more than capacity we return False
        4. When we reach end point, we decrement passengers and continue.
        
        Example : [[8,2,3],[4,1,3],[1,3,6],[8,4,6],[4,4,8]]
        Capacity : 12
