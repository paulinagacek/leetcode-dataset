w: array, prefix sum
h: this is a prefix-sum like problem, but we only
    need to care about the last element in the list
    so we only need to store the last element
    and compare to previous result
    
Time: O(N)
space: O(1)

prefix-sum: a = [0, 1, 2, 3]
what is the sum up to the current index in the array?

res = [a[0]]
for i in a[1:]:
    res.append(res[-1]+i)
