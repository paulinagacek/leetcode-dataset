        We will be passing a tuple into the queue. Originally, I wanted to do heap.push((node.val, node))
        But in this case, we\'ll get a runtime error. heapq uses the first item of an inserted tuple. If two tuples are inserted,
        it compares by the next item in the tuple. (1, node1) and (1, node2) will generated a TypeError. This is becuase the node
        class Leetcode provided does not have a __lt__ function, that is, nodes can\'t be compared! We remedy this by setting a counter
        as the second item in our tuple. So instead of (node.val, node), we will input (node.val, counter, node) then increment the counter.
        This way, if two nodes have the same val, we get the one that entered the heap first, which will have a lower counter val. 
        In any case if we have items like this in there: (1, 0, node1), (2, 1, node), (-1, 3, node), when we pop, we will get in order:
        (-1, 3, node), (1, 0, node1), (2, 1, node). So regardless the counter value, we will get the smallest items first! The counter is more
        like the priorit in which we get them! Hope that made sense!
