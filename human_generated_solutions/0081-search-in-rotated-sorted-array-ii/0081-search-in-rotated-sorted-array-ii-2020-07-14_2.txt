                ## now we should check whether the target lies between

            elif nums[mid]>nums[high]:
                \'\'\'
				To understand this part, consider the following case:
				nums = [0,0,1,1,2,0] and target = 0
				low = 0, high = 5 and mid = 2
				nums[mid]>nums[high]
				\'\'\'
				
                if nums[low] <= target < nums[mid]:
				## if the value of target is in between low and high, the shift high to mid-1. 
				## Like in the example above
                    
                    high = mid-1
                else:
				## Otherwise shift the value of low to mid +1. 
				## Consider target =2 in the above example to understand better.
                    low = mid+1
                
            else:
                \'\'\'
				This will execute when nums[mid] and nums[high] are same.
				For e.g: 
				nums=[2,2,2,2,3,4,5,2] and target = 4
				here, low = 0, high = 7 and mid = 3
				nums[mid] = nums[high] and thus we can\'t be certain about which direction to go. 
				But one thing is sure, the value is definitely not at the high position.
				So just decrease the value of high pointer
