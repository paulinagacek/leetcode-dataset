        # logic : #
        #   1. we store value = (frequency, key) pair in heap
        #   2. by default heapq in python is min heap. It is sorted based on value[0].
        #   3. so we multiply -1 with frequency, so as to get maximum frequent element from value[1] (as heap return minimum and we stored with negative sign)
