w: Counter, introduce a variable to record the number of 1 and 0
    we met so far
h: 1) if we meet 1, we increase the preSum by 1
   2) otherwise, decrease it by 1
       1) when we met the same preSum later, we know
            the number of 1 and 0 is the same in
            this range
   3) if we meet preSum = 0 later, we know that the number of
        1 and 0 is equal from current index to the begining.
